# GeMMM - Generalized Mobile Movement Model
This package allows users to sample origin-destination matrices describing the movement of individuals between different areas of the UK. Since samples are drawn from models previously parameterized using mobile telecoms data, multiple realizations can quickly be generated with only a few lines of code. Full documentation for the package, including a tutorial, is available on the [documentation](https://ukhsa-collaboration.github.io/gemmm/) page.
