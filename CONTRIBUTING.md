# Contributing to GeMMM
If you have found a bug, please search the [issues](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/gemmm/issues) tab to see if it has already been reported. If it has not been reported, open a new issue with a title and clear description of the bug, along with the expected behaviour.

To propose a new feature or fix a bug:
 - Fork the repo and create a new branch for your change. When you are happy with your changes, commit them and include clear commit messages. Finally, create a pull request and, where appropriate, link it to the issue you are solving.
 - Add unit tests, following the structure of the [current tests](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/gemmm/tree/main/tests).
 - Update the example and documentation to demonstrate the new feature.
 - If your pull request fails to build or pass tests, promptly push another commit to fix it.
